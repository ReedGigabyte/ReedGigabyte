## Heyo!

### I'm Reed GB, or Reed Gigabyte.

I'm a student at University of Colorado Boulder where I'm studying computer science. 
I have experience in C++, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, R, SQL, and LaTex.

I love to solve Sudoku puzzles and read. 

My two truths and lie:
 - I know how to play the accordion
 - I know how to ride a unicycle
 - I know how to juggle
